The left and right thumb of RangeNavigator are used to indicate the selected range in the large collection of data. Through following ways you can select a range.

* By dragging the thumbs.
* By tapping on the labels.
* By setting the start and end through value properties.

Following code example shows how to configure the selected range using [`Value`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Charts_ChartSeries_DrawType) property of RangeNavigator.
