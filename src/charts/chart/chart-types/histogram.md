# Histogram Series

[`Histogram type charts`](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-charts/chart-types/histogram-chart) can provide a visual display of large amounts of data that are difficult to understand in a tabular or spreadsheet form. To render a histogram chart, use series `Type` as `Histogram`.

{% aspTab template="chart/series/other-types/histogram", sourceFiles="histogram.razor" %}

{% endaspTab %}
