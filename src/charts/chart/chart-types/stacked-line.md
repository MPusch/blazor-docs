# Stacked Line

## Stacked

[`Blazor Stacked Line Chart`](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-charts/chart-types/stacked-line-chart)  is like a line chart where lines of the data don’t get overlapped because they will be cumulative at each point. To render a stacked line series, use series `Type` as `StackingLine`.

{% aspTab template="chart/series/line-charts/stacked-line", sourceFiles="stacked-line.razor" %}

{% endaspTab %}
