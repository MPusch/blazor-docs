# Pareto chart

Pareto charts are used to find the cumulative values of data in different categories. It is a combination of column and line series.
The initial values are represented by column chart and the cumulative values are represented by line chart.
To render a pareto chart, use series [`Type`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor~Syncfusion.Blazor.Charts.ChartSeries~Type.html) as **Pareto**.

{% aspTab template="chart/series/other-types/pareto", sourceFiles="pareto.razor" %}
