# Chart Series

## Multiple Series

You can add multiple series to the chart by using [`ChartSeries`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Charts.ChartSeries.html) property. The series are rendered in the order in which they are added to the array of series.

{% aspTab template="chart/series/multiple-series", sourceFiles="multiple-series.razor" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Combination Series

Combination of different types like line, column etc, can be rendered in a chart.

>Bar series cannot be combined with any other series as the axis orientation is different from other series.

{% aspTab template="chart/series/combination", sourceFiles="combination.razor" %}

{% endaspTab %}
