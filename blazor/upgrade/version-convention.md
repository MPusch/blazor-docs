# Version Convention for Blazor NuGet packages

In a year, Syncfusion releases new volumes once every three months.

Syncfusion Blazor component follows sequence-based identifiers to process software releases based on the **Major.Minor.Build.Revision** format to track all the release changes. It helps other developers to keep track of our changes in every release.

For example, if we release a package version as 18.4.0.43, the version numbers will be indicated like below.

 > * **18** as `Major release` – Which changes every year.
 > * **4** as `Volume release` – We release a new Volume once every three months, and this is the fourth release for this year.
 > * **0** as `Build Number` - Particular Build Number is mentioned and it will always be marked as zero.
 > * **43** as `Patch Number` - Particular Service Pack release or Patch release number, it increases every release.
