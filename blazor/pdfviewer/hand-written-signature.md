# Handwritten Signature in Blazor PDF Viewer Component

The PDF Viewer control supports adding handwritten signatures to a PDF document. The handwritten signature reduces the paper work of reviewing the content and verifies it digitally.

## Adding a handwritten signature to the PDF document

The handwritten signature can be added to the PDF document using the annotation toolbar.

* Click the **Edit Annotation** button in the PDF Viewer toolbar. A toolbar appears below it.
* Select the **HandWritten Signature** button in the annotation toolbar. The signature panel will appear.
