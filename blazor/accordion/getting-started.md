# Getting Started with Blazor Accordion Component

This section briefly explains about how to include a [Accordion](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.SfAccordion.html) in the Blazor server-side application. Refer [Getting Started with Syncfusion Blazor for Server-Side in Visual Studio](../getting-started/blazor-server-side-visual-studio/) page for the introduction and configuring the common specifications.

To get start quickly with Blazor Accordion, check on the following video:

## Importing Syncfusion Blazor component in the application

Any one of the following standards can be used to install the Syncfusion Blazor library in the application.

### Using Syncfusion Blazor individual NuGet Packages [New standard]

> Starting with Volume 4, 2020 (v18.4.0.30) release, Syncfusion provides [individual NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages) for the Syncfusion Blazor components. This new standard is highly recommended for the Blazor production applications. Refer to [this section](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages#benefits-of-using-individual-nuget-packages) to know the benefits of the individual NuGet packages.

1. Install [Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations/) NuGet package to the application using the `NuGet Package Manager`.

2. Add the client-side style resources through [CDN](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#cdn-reference) or from the [NuGet](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets) package in the `<head>` element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

    ```html
    <head>
        ....
        ....
        <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    </head>
    ```

    W> `Syncfusion.Blazor` package should not be installed along with the [individual NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages). Hence, add the above [Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/) static web assets (styles) in the application.

### Using Syncfusion.Blazor NuGet Package [Old standard]

W> If the above new standard ([individual NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages)) is preferred , then skip this section. Using both the old and new standards in the same application will throw ambiguous compilation errors.

1. Install **Syncfusion.Blazor** NuGet package to the newly created application by using the `NuGet Package Manager`.

2. Add the client-side style resources through [CDN](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#cdn-reference) or from [NuGet](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets) package in the `<head>` element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

    ```html
    <head>
        ....
        ....
        <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor/styles/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
         @*<link href="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/{{ site.blazorversion }}/styles/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />*@
    </head>
    ```

    > For Internet Explorer 11 kindly refer the polyfills. Refer the [documentation](../common/how-to/render-blazor-server-app-in-ie/) for more information.

    ```html
    <head>
        ...
            <link href="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/{{ site.blazorversion }}/styles/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
            <script src="https://github.com/Daddoon/Blazor.Polyfill/releases/download/3.0.1/blazor.polyfill.min.js"></script>
        ...
    </head>
    ```

## Adding component package to the application

Open the `~/_Imports.razor` file and import the `Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations` package.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations
```

## Add SyncfusionBlazor service in Startup file

Open the **Startup.cs** file and add services required by the Syncfusion components using the **services.AddSyncfusionBlazor()** method. Add this method in the **ConfigureServices** function as follows.

```c#
using Syncfusion.Blazor;

namespace BlazorApplication
{
    public class Startup
    {
        ....
        ....
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            ....
            ....
            services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding Accordion component to the application

Now, add the Syncfusion Blazor Accordion component in any web page (razor) in the `Pages` folder. For example, the Accordion component is added in the `~/Pages/Index.razor` page.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations

<SfAccordion>
    <AccordionItems>
        <AccordionItem Header="Margeret Peacock" Content="Margeret Peacock was born on Saturday , 01 December 1990. Now lives at Coventry House Miner Rd., London,UK. Margeret Peacock holds a position of Sales Coordinator in our WA department, (Seattle USA). Joined our company on Saturday , 01 May 2010"></AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem Header="Laura Callahan" Content="Laura Callahan was born on Tuesday , 06 November 1990. Now lives at Edgeham Hollow Winchester Way, London,UK.

        <AccordionItem Header="Albert Dodsworth" Content="Albert Dodsworth was born on Thursday , 19 October 1989.
