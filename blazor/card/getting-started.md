# Getting Started with Blazor Card Component

This section briefly explains about how to include a [Card](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Cards.SfCard.html) in your Blazor server-side application. You can refer to our Getting Started with [Syncfusion Blazor for Server-Side in Visual Studio 2019](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-2019/) page for the introduction and configuring the common specifications.

## Importing Syncfusion Blazor component in the application

1. Install **Syncfusion.Blazor.Card** NuGet package to the application by using the **NuGet Package Manager**.

2. You can add the client-side style resources through [CDN](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#cdn-reference) or from [NuGet](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets) package in the **HEAD** element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

```cshtml
<head>
    <environment include="Development">
    ....
    ....
        <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor/styles/fabric.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <!---CDN--->
        @*<link href="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/18.4.42/styles/fabric.css" rel="stylesheet" />*@
   </environment>
</head>

```

> For Internet Explorer 11 kindly refer the polyfills. Refer the [documentation](../common/how-to/render-blazor-server-app-in-ie/) for more information.

```cshtml
<head>
   <environment include="Development">
      <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor/styles/fabric.css" rel="stylesheet" />
      <script src="https://github.com/Daddoon/Blazor.Polyfill/releases/download/3.0.1/blazor.polyfill.min.js"></script>
  </environment>
</head>

```

## Adding component package to the application

Open `**~/_Imports.razor` file and import the `Syncfusion.Blazor.**`

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Cards
```

## Add SyncfusionBlazor service in Startup.cs

Open the **Startup.cs** file and add services required by Syncfusion components using **service.AddSyncfusionBlazor()** method. Add this method in the **ConfigureServices** function as follows.

```csharp

using Syncfusion.Blazor;
namespace BlazorApplication
{
    public class Startup
    {
        ....
        ....
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            ....
            ....
            services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding Card component

To initialize the Card component, add the below code to your **Index.razor** view page which is present under **~/Pages** folder.

```cshtml
<SfCard> Sample Card </SfCard>
```

## Adding a header and content

1. You can create Card with a header in a specific structure. For adding header you can use `CardHeader` tag and in that `Title` and `SubTitle` can be given.

2. Also content will be added by using `CardContent` tag.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Cards

<div class="control-section">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6">
            <SfCard>
                <CardHeader Title="Debunking Five Data Science Myths" SubTitle="By John Doe | Jan 20, 2018" />
                <CardContent Content="Tech evangelists are currently pounding their pulpits about all things AI, machine learning, analyticsâ€”anything that sounds like the future and probably involves lots of numbers. Many of these topics can be grouped under the intimidating term data science." />
            </SfCard>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Run the application

After successful compilation of your application, the Syncfusion Blazor Card component will render in the web browser.
