# Add Syncfusion Blazor component code

Syncfusion provides the Code Generator for the Blazor platform to add a code in the application quickly at the required place in the razor file. The Syncfusion extension adds the required Syncfusion component to render the code with namespaces, styles, and NuGet references. The Code Generator provides an easy-to-use wizard that interacts with data models and adds Syncfusion components with the required features to the application.

The following steps will help to add the Syncfusion components code in the Blazor application through **Visual Studio 2019**:

> Before using the Syncfusion Blazor Code Generator, check whether the Syncfusion Blazor Extension is installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed. If it is not installed, please install the [Syncfusion Blazor Extension](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/visual-studio-integration/visual-studio-extensions/download-and-installation/).

1. Open the existing Blazor application.

2. To open the Syncfusion Blazor Code Generator Wizard, select one of the following options in the Razor file, and add Syncfusion components:

   **Option 1:**

   To generate a specific component code, right-click the editor of the Razor file at the required line and select the **Syncfusion Blazor Code Generator...**

    **Data Binding:** Data operation fields will be visible if the selected component has data. The data will be listed from the application.

    **Feature:** Selected component features are listed. You can select the required features.

    **Control requirements:** Contains the required user input fields for the selected component. The required value can be provided for those fields to add the component code.

## Syncfusion integration

The project will configure the required NuGet packages, style, namespaces, and services when the Syncfusion component is being added.

### NuGet Packages

The corresponding component NuGet packages will be added as NuGet references.

> The installed Syncfusion extension version of a NuGet package will be added as a reference entry if there is no internet connection. The NuGet packages have to be restored when the internet connection is restored.
