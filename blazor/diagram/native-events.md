# Native Events in Blazor Diagram Component

The Diagram control provides event support, which triggers while interacting with the diagram. Also, Syncfusion provides native event support in blazor for the following events

| Event Name | Event Type |
| -------- | -------- |
| onfocus | FocusEventArgs |
| onclick | MouseEventArgs |
| onmousemove | MouseEventArgs |
| onmouseover | MouseEventArgs |
| onmouseout | MouseEventArgs |
| onmousedown | MouseEventArgs |
| onmouseup | MouseEventArgs |
| ondblclick | MouseEventArgs |
| onkeydown | KeyboardEventArgs |
| onkeyup | KeyboardEventArgs |
| ondrop | DragEventArgs |

The native events can be defined as mentioned below. For example, the onmousedown event in diagram.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams

<SfDiagram @onmousedown="@OnMouseDown" Height="600px"/>

@code
{
    public void OnMouseDown(MouseEventArgs args)
    {
        //Action to be performed
    }
}
```
