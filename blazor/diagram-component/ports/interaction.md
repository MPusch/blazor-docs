# Interaction in Blazor Diagram Component

The port can be dragged in the diagram area and create the connector over the port by using the `port constraints`.

## Draw

Diagram provides the support to draw the connector in the port.

The following code explains how to draw the connector by using the port constraints.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagram

<SfDiagramComponent Height="600px" Nodes="@nodes" />

@code
{
    DiagramObjectCollection<Node> nodes;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        nodes = new DiagramObjectCollection<Node>();
        // A node is created and stored in nodes array.
        Node node = new Node()
        {
            // Position of the node
            OffsetX = 250,
            OffsetY = 250,
            // Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            Style = new ShapeStyle() { Fill = "#6495ED", StrokeColor = "white" },
            // Initialize port collection
            Ports = new DiagramObjectCollection<PointPort>()
            {
                new PointPort()
                {
                    ID = "port1",
                    Offset = new Point() { X = 0.5, Y = 0.5 },
                    Visibility = PortVisibility.Visible,
                    //Set the style for the port
                    Style= new ShapeStyle(){ Fill = "gray", StrokeColor = "black"},
                    // Sets the shape of the port as Circle
                    Width = 12, Height = 12, Shape = PortShapes.X,
                    // Enable drag operation for Port
                    Constraints = PortConstraints.Default|PortConstraints.Draw
                }
            },
        };
        nodes.Add(node);
    }
}
```
