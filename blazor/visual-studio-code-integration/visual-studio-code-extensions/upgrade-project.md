# Upgrade project in Blazor

Syncfusion Project Migration is a Visual Studio Code add-in that allows to migrate the existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application from one Essential Studio version to another version.

   > The Syncfusion Blazor Web Application Project Migration utility is available from `v17.4.0.39`.

The following steps helps to migrate the existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application.

1. Open an existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application or create a new Syncfusion Blazor Web Application in Visual Studio Code.

2. Right-click the Project file from Explorer (Workspace), select the `Migrate Syncfusion Blazor Application to another versionâ€¦`. Refer to the following screenshot for more information.

5. If the trial setup or NuGet packages are installed from nuget.org, register the Syncfusion license key to the project since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to the project.
